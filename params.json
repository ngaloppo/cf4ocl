{"name":"Cf4ocl","tagline":"C Framework for OpenCL","body":"cf4ocl - C Framework for OpenCL\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe C Framework for OpenCL (cf4ocl) is a pure C99 set of libraries and\r\nutilities for speeding-up the development and benchmarking of OpenCL \r\nprograms. It's main target platform is Linux, although previous\r\nversions were sucessfully compiled in Windows with [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). \r\nThe only dependency is [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) (v2.23\r\nor newer), the development files of which can be easily installed from\r\nyour distro's package manager. Library code is licensed under [LGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html),\r\nwhile the remaining code is licensed under [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).\r\n\r\nThe code is fully commented (docs can be generated with Doxygen, \r\npreferably with version 1.8.3 or newer), is compiled with `-Wall` and\r\n`-Wextra` flags, and is veryfied with [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* **Library**\r\n    * CL Utils\r\n    * CL Profiler\r\n    * GError framework\r\n* **Library tests**\r\n    * CL Profiler\r\n    * GError framework\r\n* **Utilities**\r\n    * Device query\r\n    * Kernel info\r\n* **Examples**\r\n    * Bank conflicts test\r\n    * Matrix multiplication\r\n\r\nLibrary\r\n-------\r\n\r\n### CL Utils\r\n\r\n* Create/initialize OpenCL objects such as plaform, device, context, \r\ncommand queues, devices, and so on with just one instruction (also one\r\ninstruction for freeing/releasing these objects).\r\n* Build an OpenCL program with one instruction by passing an array of\r\nfilenames containing the kernels.\r\n* Automatic or manual device selecion.\r\n* Doesn't hide OpenCL objects from you.\r\n\r\n### CL Profiler\r\n\r\n* Get detailed profiling information about OpenCL events, including\r\nrelative and absolute times.\r\n* Supports multiple command queues and overlapping events (e.g. such\r\nas simultaneous kernel execution and data transfer).\r\n\r\n### GError framework\r\n\r\n* Generic C error handling framework based on GError object from GLib.\r\n* Just two macros.\r\n\r\nUtilities\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### Device query\r\n\r\nSimple implementation of a program for querying available OpenCL\r\nplatforms and devices with clean and useful output.\r\n\r\n### Kernel info\r\n\r\nStatic analysis of OpenCL kernels.\r\n\r\nHow to use the library\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nTake a look at the examples, utilities and tests to see how the \r\nlibrary can be used.\r\n\r\nOther useful C frameworks/utilities for OpenCL\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* [Simple OpenCL](http://code.google.com/p/simple-opencl/)\r\n* [The OpenCL utility library](https://github.com/Oblomov/CLU)\r\n* [Computing Language Utility](https://github.com/Computing-Language-Utility/CLU)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
